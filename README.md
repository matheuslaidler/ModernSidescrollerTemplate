# ModernSidescrollerTemplate
The default sidescroller template from the previous version, Unreal Engine 4, is no longer available, maybe cause this can be develop using the third-person template. To save your time without need to use UE4 template, I have taken the initiative to create an updated version for UE5 and share the project here for anyone who is interested.
