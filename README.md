![2ndSidescrollerTemplatePreview](https://github.com/matheuslaidler/ModernSidescrollerTemplate/assets/76860503/9b74a957-e050-40bd-8add-181e7e92fed1)

###### Made in UE5.3 – fully working in UE5.5, but only if downloaded via git clone. Downloading with GitHub’s browser button may cause missing assets due to Git LFS limitations.

The traditional sidescroller template that was a staple in Unreal Engine 4 is no longer at your disposal. Maybe, this change arises from the recognition that the same sidescrolling style can now be seamlessly achieved using the third-person template (and some time to adapt). I did this repository to streamline your game development process and eliminate the need for constant template adjustments or the reliance on the outdated UE4 version. 

In other words, to spare you the burden of continually adapting the third-person template to a side-scroller one or always relying on the outdated UE4 version for new UE5 projects, I've taken the initiative to craft an updated version exclusively designed for Unreal Engine 5.

This foundational project is provided here for those who are looking to create a sidescroller with ease and wish to utilize an Unreal template like we had in the previous version - UE4. It offers an efficient and contemporary solution for your sidescroller game projects. My Enhanced Sidescroller Template for UE5 offers practicality, making it easier than ever for you to bring your 3D sidescroller visions to life. It will help u to save some time, so it's a good project to favorite if you're just starting your journey, or even if you're a seasoned developer. This template can be your gateway to a sidescrolling dev experience in Unreal Engine 5.

It offers a comprehensive range of features found in other templates, such as the third-person template. Our template includes IK-Foot, retarget rig compatibility with both UE5 and UE4 skeletons, level prototypes, a 'New' input mode, and more. We've also fine-tuned essential elements like gravity, camera lag, and jumping mechanics, implementing numerous simple configurations to ensure smooth and satisfying gameplay, akin to the experience in others UE5 Templates or UE4 Default SideScroller Template.

Tested with my own character made with UE4 Skeleton (Don't need to retarget)

### Important Notice About GitHub Downloads  
If you download the project using the GitHub browser button, `.umap` files tracked with Git LFS may appear as 1KB placeholders, causing issues when opening the project. To ensure all assets are correctly retrieved, **clone the repository using Git and Git LFS**:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/matheuslaidler/ModernSidescrollerTemplate.git
git lfs pull
```

This guarantees that all Unreal Engine assets, including `.umap` files, are properly downloaded and usable.  
For more details on this Git LFS limitation, check [GitHub’s documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage).  

If you download the project using GitHub's browser button, .umap files and other assets tracked with Git LFS may appear as 1KB placeholders, causing issues when opening the project.

While you can manually download each file separately from the repository (and they will have the correct size), you would need to replace all affected files, not just the .umap, to make the project work. Since this process can be tedious and error-prone, the best way to ensure everything functions correctly is to clone the repository using Git, cause this guarantees that all Unreal Engine assets are properly downloaded, avoiding any missing or corrupted files.
